JENKINS
-> Jenkins is a CI/CD Tool used by Developers, DevOps and Automation Testers.
-> CI -> Continuous Integration
   CD -> Continuous Deployment
      -> Continuous Delivery

=> Basically Jenkins automates 
   -> Process of build creation - Continuous development
   -> Process of installing the build into testing environment - Continuous deployment
   -> Process of checking the integration issues between old feature and new features
      - continuous integration 
   -> Process of delivering the tested the build to the production environment
      - Continuous delivery

=> Why Jenkins is required in development?

-> Continuous Delivery : get the latest build from git location & deploy the build in to 
                           UAT environment/Production environment through manual intervention
-> Continuous deployment : It is similar to Continuous Delivery but here the process is automated
			   i.e., there is no human intervention

=> Why Jenkins is required in Automation?

-> Continuous Integration : Continuous execution of the selenium test scripts in testing 
                             environment to check the integration issues. 
  
-> Automation Engineers used Jenkins For Continuous Integration
   Continuous Integration means checking the integration issues between the old build and
   the new feature by executing the old framework. if the test scripts get failed, then 
   with the failure we will get to know the impact of new feature on the old build. hence
   we can analyse the failure, debug the failed test scripts, if any product issues/bugs 
   are found we will rise the defect in Jira, if its a test script issue we will correct it
   update the framework and re run the framework.

=> Jenkins Configuration
   -> Login to Jenkins
   -> Set path for jdk, git, Maven.

=> scheduling Job in Jenkins:
   Scheduling decides when the job execution should be triggered or started.
   There are 3 types of Scheduling in Jenkins:
   -> On Demand
   -> On schedule
   -> Poll SCM

1. On Demand scheduling:
   -> When ever the customer demands the execution, we will trigger the execution with 
      Build Now option available.  
   -> There is no stipulated times for execution, when ever customer demands, we can run
   -> Build Now is the action performed for On demand scheduling.

2. On Schedule scheduling:
   -> Specifying the exact time duration of when the execution should start is called on 
      schedule scheduling.
   -> While configuring the job only we have to provide "build periodically" in 
      Build Triggers.
   -> Jenkins follow a specific scheduling format

      MINUTE  HOUR   DOM    MONTH   DOW
      (0-59) (0-23) (1-31) (1-12)  (0-7)-> 0,7=Sunday

      # Every Tuesday at 12pm
        H   12   *  *  *    -> Here "H" means hash -> specifies "any", "*" specifies "every"
      # Every fifteen minutes (perhaps at :07, :22, :37, :52):
	H/15 * * * *
      # Every ten minutes in the first half of every hour 
	H(0-29)/10 * * * *
      # Once every two hours at 45 minutes past the hour starting 
        45 9-16/2 * * 1-5
      # Once in every two hour slot between 8 AM and 4 PM every weekday
	H H(8-15)/2 * * 1-5
      # Once a day on the 1st and 15th of every month except December
        H H 1,15 1-11 *

   -> On Schedule does not bother if the framework is updated or not, it will start the 
      execution immediately in the specified time schedule.

3. Poll SCM:
   -> Poll SCM will detect the changes made in specified git location (SCM- Source Code
      management) and it will start the execution on the scheduled time.
   -> Here the schedule will be usually 
      H * * * * 
   -> When ever any changes is detected like new  push /commit it will trigger the job.
   -> When we make any changes in the framework, it has to pushed into git master repo 
      or if its pushed into any branches then it has to be reviewed and merged into the 
      master. 
   -> Usually Master repo of the framework will be configured with Jenkins and if any
      new commit is recognised, Jenkins will start the execution based on schedule.
  
=> Advantages of Jenkins:
a. Jenkins Provide 3 level of execution 
   - On demand    : based on Customer demand we can start the execution
   - On Scheduling: based on scheduled time , start the execution automatically
   - POLL SCM     : where continuously monitor the SCM(GitHub) & automatically start the 
                    execution whenever we get new Build / one new test script is getting added
                    to Git.  
b. Email Notification:
   - Jenkins sends out an execution Report via email, once execution is completed
   - Jenkins also Send Build broken Email, when Compilation issue between the 
     framework component 
c. Jenkins also support run time parameter using Maven Parameters

Job:
Each and every task that is present in Jenkins is considered as JOB. Each job should be configured
with GitHub repository by passing the repo URL.

Goals and Options:
In this section we provide the maven command which need to be executed for that respective job.
