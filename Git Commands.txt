Git Commands
-------------

i. To initialize the project i.e., to create a local repository (one time process)

	git init

ii. Git configuration (important for identifying authors)(one time process -- globally)

	git config --global user.name username
	git config --global user.email usermail

iii. Adding files to local repository

	git add filename  (for specific file)
	git add .	  (for adding all the unstaged/untracked files)

iv. Commit operation i.e., act of saving changes to local repository or snapshot of project's file system

	git commit -m "commit message"		(commit should always have a commit message)

v. Connecting remote repository (git repo) to local repo

	git remote add origin GithubRepoUrl		(origin is just like a name which will act like a folder to store and carry the files to github, we can have any name)

vi. Push operation

	git push origin master		(pushing the project to master branch in GitHub, either it can be master or main)

vii. To clone a project from git repository

	git clone GitRepoUrl

viii. To create a branch

	git branch branchname

ix. To list all the branches which is present in a project in working directory (active one will be highlighted)

	git branch

x. To switch to a branch

	git switch branchname

xi. To push a branch from local repo to git repo

	git push origin branchname

xii. For merging a branch to master in local repository, first switch to master branch

	git merge branchname

xiii. To list all the branches present in local repository

	git branch -r

xiv. After cloning any project to local repository, again we have to do the configuration to perform commit and push operation from that system

	git config user.name username
	git config user.email usermail

xv. To get the branches too from the remote repository after cloning the project (just switch to that branch)

	git switch branchname

xvi. To perform Pull operation

	git pull origin master		(sometimes it can be main in GitHub so in place of master we will use main)

xvii. To check the status of the file which is added to local repository from the working directory, status of staged and unstaged changes

	git status

xviii. To get  the details of the commit (or commit history) with details (like commit id, etc)

	git log

xix. With git log we have other options

	git log --oneline	-->	gives detail of commit history in one line

	git log --graph		-->	graphical representation (useful to view branches and merges)

	git log --since="2024-12-24"	-->	shows commit history after this date

xx. To view the remote connection (after remote connection is done) associated with the local repository

	git remote -v

xxi. To remove remote connection i.e., to disconnect the GitHub repository from local repository (it is done if we want to connect to other remote repo)

	git remote remove origin
